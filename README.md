# Employee_Payroll_System
Payroll System  – A console-based application that manages employees using object-oriented design principles. It supports adding, removing, and displaying employee details with dynamic salary calculation for both full-time and part-time staff. This project demonstrates clean code practices, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism in Core Java.


This is a simple Java program that shows how a payroll system works using **OOP concepts**.

## What it does
- Add employees (full-time or part-time)
- Remove employees by ID
- Show employee details with calculated salary

## Example
Initial Employee Details:
Employee [name=John Doe, id=101, salary=5000.0]
Employee [name=Jane Smith, id=102, salary=450.0]

Removing Employee...

Remaining Employee Details:
Employee [name=Jane Smith, id=102, salary=450.0]
